This license grants you, the brave and/or desperate user, permission to use, remix, publish, deep-fry, or ritualistically sacrifice this AI-generated code in any way you see fit.

Terms (very optional, mostly vibes):

- You may use this code for personal, professional, artistic, or extremely cursed purposes.
- You may modify it, break it, fork it, feed it to another AI, or print it out and use it as origami.
- No warranties. No guarantees. No refunds. No gods, no bugs, just vibes.
- If this code causes mild chaos, data loss, or existential dread, that’s a you problem.
- You don’t have to give credit, but if you do, consider shouting “thanks, robot!” into the void.
